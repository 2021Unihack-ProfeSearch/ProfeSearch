# Welcome to ProfeSearch!

## Goal
Hello! We are ProfeSearch. Our aim is to help students and university faculties to share resources and opportunities, such as research and internship opportunities on campus, more effectively! 

As college students who have planned to study abroad, most of us are suffering from "ÂÜÖÂç∑" or involution, which refers to students incessantly competing with each other while everyone does not have equal access to all resources. Adding to this, we haven't been able to know our campus and professors in-person due to COVID. The unfamiliarity with university faculties has caused us to feel anxious when finding resources, especially research and internship opportunities on campus. Having emails as the only way of communicating these university opportunities, the communication efficiency has been extremely low. What should we do? Here comes ProfeSearch. 


On ProfeSearch, faculties can post their opportunities or new positions tagged with different standards such as target audience and academic majors desired. Students can then filtered different positions recommended by ProfeSearch based on various searching conditions, such as whether it is in person or remote. 
With ProfeSearch, students can ease their process of finding suitable research, internship, or other opportunities on campus. 

With ProfeSearch, students' inboxes won't be "bombarded" with potentially wrongly targeted recruitment emails, and faculties are more likely to find more suitable students for their positions! Although there has been many recruitment applications and websites in presence, a platform that is particularly tailored to college students and faculties is definitely needed, so that the communication efficiency can be enhanced, and universities' educational resources can be utilized more proficiently, which will alleviate both psychological anxieties and the involution phenomenon.

### We hope you will like ProfeSearch. Thank you!ü•≥ü•≥
